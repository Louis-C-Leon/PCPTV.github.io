Welcome to your site, Jacob! Here's a rundown on how to add or edit stuff. The site is built from files in this project, so you can change a lot by adding, deleting, and changing these files. Let's go through the important files.

First, find `_config.yml`; it's not in a folder. This file has some basic information about your site that applies to every page. Try adding or updating contact information here, and then save the file.

Next, take a look at our **Pages**. The posts are every file that ends in `.md` besides `README.md`. At the start, we only have `index.md`, `blog.md`, and `other_pods.md`; those are your 3 pages right now. If you look at those files, you'll see a top section, and a bottom section.

- The top part, in between the `---` lines, is where you put data like the title, layout, and etc. For now, it's best that you copy that part from an existing page if you make a new page, because it's easy to make typos.
- The bottom part, below the second `---` line, is the content of the page. You can write whatever you want here, and it's harder to make typos. [Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a guide if you want to do things like bold, italic, lists, and etc. But plain text works fine, too.

Next, take a look at our **Posts**. These are all the files inside the`_posts/` folder. NOTE that every file in `_posts/` needs to be named with the right format. Like `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`. It needs to have that date as the file name, and if it's not a real date (or the date is in the future), your new post won't publish.

Take a look at one of these files; it's also divided into a top and bottom part. For new posts, it's best for you to copy the top part from a test post, follow the directions for pasting media links that I included, and just change the parts you need to.

So, you can add, edit, and delete pages and posts by messing with these files! Why don't you try it out yourself?
NOTE: If you add new posts, they're published automatically. But if you add new pages, you'll have to ask me to add the link to your new page into the header. Otherwise you won't be able to see it.
