# GUEST POST TEST

# Welcome to the test post! You can copy and paste this text into a
# new file and then edit it whenever you want to make a new post.
# this top section contains the data about the post, and goes in
# between the "---" lines. Below that is the text of the post, in
# markdown format (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

# Lines between the "---" lines that start with "#" are comments
# for your reference and are ignored by the site.

# This next line makes the post not show up! Put `published: false` to make the post invisible.

# NOTE that the file name for your posts is IMPORTANT. When you make a
# new post, make sure it's named like this:

# Media links go here, make sure they look like the same format as
# these! For the Spotify link, click the '...' menu for the playlist,
# choose "Share", and click "Copy Spotify URI". For these episodes, you
# can paste a Spotify link, YouTube, Vimeo, Google Drive (audio file),
# Bandcamp, or SoundCloud.

# For Google Drive, upload the audio file to your Drive account. Open the file
# in drive and click "Share". Get the link, and make sure you see "Anyone on the
# internet with this link can view". Paste the link using the format below:

# media:
#  type: drive
#  link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TTYZxPdmONGUbazMS_OEGDtS4oOmUa5A/view?usp=sharing

# Spotify: Find the track, click the '...' menu, select "Share", then select

# For Soundcloud and Bandcamp media, you'll have to paste a longer embed code instead of just a link.
# These should always be surrounded by single quotes: ('')
# Also, if you mostly use SoundCloud and Bandcamp media, it cana make your site load way slower.

# Select "Embed", then copy the "code" text and paste it here as shown below.
# dont forget to put single quotes ('') around the whole code block!
